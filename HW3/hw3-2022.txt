Q1: We will discuss a space-saving technique for pairwise sequence alignment
    based on divide-and-conquer this week. The technique can be easily
    extended to multiple sequence alignment. Your task is to design an
    O(m*n) space, O(m*n*k) time SP alignment algorithm for three DNA
    sequences of lengths m, n and k, respectively. Implement your algorithm
    in C/C++/Java/Python, and test it on real data.

    You may find discussions on the space-saving technique for pairwise 
    sequence comparison in the books by Jones and Pevzner, by Gusfield, 
    and by Jiang, Xu, and Zhang (Current Topics in Computational Biology, 
    MIT Press Series on Computational Molecular Biology, 2002). The 
    following original papers provide more detailed information:

    problem. J.ACM, 24:664-75, 1977.

    alignment methods: a survey. Journal of Computational Biology.
    Vol. 1-4, pp. 271-291. 1994. 

    (i)  For simplicity, let's consider global alignment and the basic 
         SP score model where gaps are not specially treated. 

    (ii) Your program should work for any score function on nucleotides.
         In other words, the user should be able to input a score function
	 in the form of a 5x5 matrix indexed by A, C, G, T, and space.
         The SP-score of a column of letters/spaces is the sum of the scores
         of each pair of letters/spaces in the column.

	 To test your program, use the Blast scores: Match = 5, Mismatch = -4,
	 and Indel = -8. The score between two spaces is 0.

   (iii) Test your program on the following five sets of sequences:

         XM_016937951. PREDICTED: Pan troglodytes hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 
                    alpha (HNF4A), transcript variant X1, mRNA, 4724 bps

         NM_000492. Homo sapiens cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance
                    regulator (ATP-binding cassette sub-family C, member 7)

         You may retrieve the sequences at http://www.ncbi.nih.gov/
	 using the accession numbers NM_013096, etc.  Select "nucleotide" in 
         the search option box. The sequence data is given at the bottom of 
         the search result page. Note that the last dataset may take your 
         algorithms quite some time to run, especially on an old computer.

    For this question, submit a report (hard copy) along with HW3 with
                                                   --------------
    (a) a high-level description of your algorithm (i.e. high-level
        pseudo-code), and the data structures used,
    (b) your source code, and
    (c) the result of your program on each dataset, including the
        score of the optimal alignment obtained, the length of the alignment,
	the number of columns with perfectly matched nucleotides in the
	alignment, and the running time and memory (on a PC or laptop
	with specification of CPU and memory). Please do not include
	the actual alignment in the report (because it is going to be quite
	loooong :-). 
    (d) Do you see any obvious conserved regions captured in your alignments?

    Although this question is optional for HW2, it could be a very good idea
    that you complete the dynamic programming routine for computing the 
    optimal score of a 3-sequence alignment in O(m*n) space, and test it on
    some small data to make sure that it is correct. The recurrence relation is
    given in Chapter 6.10 of the textbook. Note that this algorithm will need
    the dynamic programming algorithm for pairwise sequence alignment to 
    initialize its matrix.

    Also, although your goal is to implement the O(mn)-space algorithm, it
    will be useful for you to implement the standard O(mnk)-space dynamic 
    programming algorithm for 3-sequence alignment and use it as a subroutine 
    in the divide-and-conquer process when one of the sequences degenerates 
    to one or zero letters.


Q2: Problem 6.57, p. 224, of Jones and Pevzner.  
    What is the running time of your improved algorithm?

    Note that besides Figure 6.28, a useful recurrence 
    relation is also given on page 33 of "Updated slides on 
    similarity based gene prediction". You should show how 
    to incorporate the function P(i,j) into your improved
    recurrence relation (i.e., your new recurrence relation
    should define both functions S(i,j,B) and P(i,j)).

Q3: Consider the following additive distance matrix:

           | A  B  C  D  E
         ------------------
         A | 0  5  7  6  9
         B | 5  0  8  5  8
         C | 7  8  0  9  12
         D | 6  5  9  0  7
         E | 9  8  12 7  0

    Use the algorithm given on Slide 54 based on Buneman's Theorem
    to iteratively reconstruct the underlining evolutionary tree.

    Can you also determine the branch lengths?
