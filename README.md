# CS238_W22
This repository contains all the source codes and scripts related to the three homework assigned in CS238 course in the Winter 2022 quarter at UCR

# HW1
This directory contains all the data, source codes and scripts related to Homework 1. "hw1-2022.txt" contains the questions for the homework.

# Data files:
1. bacillus_genome.fasta: It contains the whole genome sequence for Bacillus amyloliquefaciens CC178 (4Mb approx)
2. random_genome.txt: It contains the randomly generated genome sequence of same length as of Bacillus a.
3. input1.txt: It contains the three test datasets for Partial Digest Problem

# Source Codes:
1. pdp.py: Branch and bound version of Partial Digest Problem is implemented here

# Scripts:
1. kmer.py: Generates the 5-mer distribution for the bacteria genome
2. randKmer.py: Generates a random genome sequence and generates the 5-mer distribution for the random sequence
3. baseCounter.py: Calculates the distribution of the four nucleotides given a genome sequence
4. xl_writer.py: Generates a spreadsheet given the kmer distribtion file as input
5. plot.py: Generates a scatter plot from the 5-mer distributions for both the bacteria genome and random sequence in a single figure

# Figures:
1. kmerDist.png: The scatter plot generated by "plot.py"

# Intermediate files:
1. bacteria_kmer.txt: 5-mer distribution for the bacteria genome
2. random_kmer.txt: 5-mer distribution for the random genome
