CS238 HW 1
Due on Jan. 27, Thursday, at 12pm via Gradescope.
Please type your answers as much as possible.


Reading: Jones and Pevzner Ch 1-4, 12; 
Gusfield, Ch 16; JXZ, Ch 2, 10.

Q1: Implement the branch-and-bound algorithm for the Partial Digest Problem
    (PDP) as given on p. 90 of Jones and Pevzner using your favoriate
    programming language (e.g., C, C++, Java or Python). Test your program on
    the following three datasets. Here, each number in parentheses indicates
    the multiplicity of the preceding number.

    L1 = {1(9), 2(8), 3(7), 4(6), 5(5), 6(4), 7(3), 8(2), 9(1)}.
  
    L2 = {1(1), 2(1), 3(2), 4(1), 5(2), 6(1), 7(1), 9(2), 10(1), 12(1), 14(1), 15(1)}.

    L3 = {1(16), 2(15), 3(14), 4(13), 5(12), 6(11), 7(10), 8(9), 9(8),
          10(9), 11(8), 12(7), 13(6), 14(5), 15(4), 16(3), 17(2), 18(1)}.

    To simpify your output, please print only the number of distinct solutions
    for each dataset (symmetric solutions are considered as the same) and up to 
    three actual distinct solutions (in any order). Please turn in your source 
    code as well as the above output found in each test.
Done.

Q2: Problem 4.9, p. 121, of Jones and Pevzner. 
Need to think about this problem later

Q3: Problem 4.14, p. 122, of Jones and Pevzner.  You may find some complete
    bacterial genomes at e.g., http://www.ebi.ac.uk/genomes/bacteria.html
    For l = 5, illustrate the frequency distributions on the bacterial genome
    and the random string (i.e., how many 5-mers having each frequency in each
    case) using a simple plot. In other words, your plot should show the number 
    of distinct 5-mers (Y-axis) that occur in the bacterial genome (or random 
    string) with each specific frequency number (X-axis). What can you observe 
    from this comparison?
Bacillus amyloliquefaciens CC178 (4MB) (3916828)
Bacteria genome seems to have a few conserved 5-mers where a generated random sequence don't have anything like that. (Coding done)

Q4: Problem 12.4, p. 417, of Jones and Pevzner.  Here, "coin tossing" basically
    means "randomization". In other words, you may assume that you can retrieve 
    random numbers according to a specific probability distribution as we did 
    in the Gibbs Sampler algorithm.
Randomization: weighted on the distance from different centroids. So, always the closest cluster may not be selected, rather cluster with lower probability can also be chosen. Since each cluster has some probability to be assigned weighted on the distance from the data point.

Q5: Problem 12.6, p. 417, of Jones and Pevzner.  
Remove a percentage of sequences from the total set of sequences rather removing only one at each iteration.
