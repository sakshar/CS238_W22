Q1: Q5 from HW2.

Q2: Problem 6.57, p. 224, of Jones and Pevzner.  
    What is the running time of your improved algorithm?

    Note that besides Figure 6.28, a useful recurrence 
    relation is also given on page 33 of "Updated slides on 
    similarity based gene prediction". You should show how 
    to incorporate the function P(i,j) into your improved
    recurrence relation (i.e., your new recurrence relation
    should define both functions S(i,j,B) and P(i,j)).

Q3: Consider the following additive distance matrix:

           | A  B  C  D  E
         ------------------
         A | 0  5  7  6  9
         B | 5  0  8  5  8
         C | 7  8  0  9  12
         D | 6  5  9  0  7
         E | 9  8  12 7  0

    Use the algorithm given on Slide 54 based on Buneman's Theorem
    to iteratively reconstruct the underlining evolutionary tree.

    Can you also determine the branch lengths?
